## Features

- **PSR-14 Compliant**: Follows the PSR-14 Event Dispatcher standards for interoperability.
- **Easy Listener Management**: Add, dispatch, and remove listeners with ease.
- **Lightweight**: Minimalistic design with no external dependencies.

## Installation

You can install this package using Composer. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
composer require riyad/psr14-event-dispatcher
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

To get started, you can create an instance of the `EventDispatcher`, add listeners, and dispatch events as shown below:

```php
use Psr14EventDispatcher\Event;
use Psr14EventDispatcher\EventDispatcher;

$eventDispatcher = new EventDispatcher();

// Define a listener
$eventDispatcher->addListener('my.event', function(Event $event) {
    echo "Event: " . $event->getName() . " was dispatched!";
});

// Create and dispatch an event
$event = new Event('my.event');
$eventDispatcher->dispatch($event);
```

In this example, when the event `my.event` is dispatched, the listener will be called, and the output will be:

```
Event: my.event was dispatched!
```

### Removing Listeners

You can also remove listeners if you no longer need them:

```php
$listener = function(Event $event) {
    echo "This won't be called.";
};

$eventDispatcher->addListener('my.event', $listener);

// Remove the listener
$eventDispatcher->removeListener('my.event', $listener);

// Dispatch the event
$eventDispatcher->dispatch(new Event('my.event'));
```

In this case, the output will be empty since the listener was removed before dispatching the event.

## Testing

This package includes tests using PHPUnit. To run the tests, ensure you have PHPUnit installed, then run the following command:

```bash
vendor/bin/phpunit tests/EventDispatcherTest.php
```

You should see output indicating that the tests have passed successfully.
